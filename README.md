# Iosevka Custom Build Demo Repository

This repository is a minimal demo showing how to set up a GitHub Actions workflow to run an Iosevka custom build.

- Purpose: demonstrate a reproducible CI-based build for Iosevka using a custom build plan.
- What it contains: an example GitHub Actions workflow and example build configuration to illustrate how to trigger and produce Iosevka build artifacts on push.
- How to use:
  1. Fork or clone this repository.
  2. Edit the custom build configuration to your needs.
  3. Push changes to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow which runs the custom build.
  4. Download the produced font artifacts from the workflow run.

The workflow could also be manually triggered via the "Actions" tab in GitHub.
